Developed a Fake News Detection system using Python and scikit-learn, achieving ~90â€“95% accuracy through cross-validation.
Engineered custom NLP features (punctuation ratios, ALL-CAPS usage, URL frequency, stopword ratios, title-body overlap, sentiment scores) in addition to TF-IDF word & character n-grams.
Implemented a Logistic Regression classifier with regularization and class-balancing to avoid overfitting and ensure robust performance.
Evaluated the model using Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices for reliable performance insights.
